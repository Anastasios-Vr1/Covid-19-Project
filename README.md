The Covid-19 Project is a data analysis and visualization project that demonstrates skills in SQL and Tableau. The project focuses on the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and includes data on death counts, infection rates, vaccination rates, and other relevant metrics.
In this project Iâ€™ve performed the following:


1. Collected data from the "Our World in Data" official website.
(Here's the link to the [Covid Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and [Covid Vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) Datasets

2. Imported the dataset into SQL

3. Performed data exploration to identify trends and patterns

4. Exported my code to GitHub for sharing and collaboration

5. Visualized the findings in a dashboard on Tableau, and provided a clear and interactive representation of the results. [(Click Here to View)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anastasios.vrakas/viz/Covid19Dashboard_16696595825080/DashboardCovid19).

The final dashboard provides a detailed overview of the Covid-19 pandemic, and highlights the key trends and insights that I have identified through my analysis. The project showcases the ability to effectively use SQL and Tableau to analyze and present data, and I hope that it will be useful for others who are interested in understanding the impact of the pandemic.
